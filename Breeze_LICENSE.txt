ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE: Any use of this software, modifications of this software or modifications or extensions of the underlying principle of the Breeze RNG implemented IN HARDWARE needs to be explicitly licensed by the copyright holder Andreas Briese (contact: ab<at>edutoolbox.de).

Note:
The purpose of this modified MIT LICENSE with ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIVE CLAUSE shall allow a unrestricted use by developers on any software platform. In case of the implementation of Breeze or it's underlying logic in RNG hardware (for example but not limited to encryption chips or PIN number generators) the producer of such hardware needs to document the proper implementation to become licensed. This takes into account that improper or wrong implementation of Breeze in hardware might decrease the quality of the the resulting random number stream.  



Important Note 2014/10/30:
Breeze had not been cryptoanalysed.
It is definitly not recommended to use Breeze and it's Hash() or XOR() functions in particular in any security sensitive or
cryptographic context.
